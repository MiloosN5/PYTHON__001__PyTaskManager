7. Update requirements.txt When You Add New Packages

    Whenever you install a new package (e.g. with pip install package-name), make sure to refresh your requirements.txt so others can install the same dependencies.

    Run this command to update the file:
    ```bash
        pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
